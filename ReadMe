Objective
The main goal is to develop a predictive model capable of assessing the likelihood of floods based on various input features that describe environmental conditions and human activities.
Data Processing
The project starts with loading datasets that likely contain historical data on flood events alongside numerous potential predictors such as Monsoon Intensity, Topography and Drainage Quality, River Management Practices, and more.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This phase includes generating summary statistics, visualizing data distributions, and conducting correlation analysis to identify relationships between features and the target variable.
Feature Engineering
Enhancing the model's predictive power through creating interaction features, summarizing information with aggregate features, and normalizing features to ensure comparability.
Model Development
The project uses LightGBM for model development, focusing on training with optimized parameters and implementing techniques like cross-validation to ensure model generalizability.
Model Validation
Assessing model performance using K-Fold cross-validation and metrics like RMSE and R2 score to quantify its accuracy and predictive power.
